# FROG Oven Reflow Controller

Designed and built a 1.5KW Solder Reflow Oven controller which connected to a relay and toaster oven. Recieved a grade of 100% for the design component and successfully reflowed the SPI module used in https://github.com/vtotient/Magnetically-Controlled-Car.

### Bonus Features

The bonus features are extra functionalities that we added to go above and beyond the task outlined by the instructors. Our oven featured a GUI, written in python, to display the oven state, temperature and any relevant warnings like "door is open". The GUI integrated optional voice command features using Google's speech recognition API so that the user can remotely start and stop the oven as well as inquire about the oven status. We also included an optional SMS start and abort feature using Twillio's API.
